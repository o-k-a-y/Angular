<!-- String interpolation example using class members -->
<!-- String interpolation only has 1 condition: resolve to a string -->
<!-- This means we could insert a function call inside {{ }} as long as the return is a string -->
<!-- Numbers are easily converted to strings, so anything that has a toString() is fine as well -->

<!-- The brackets in [ngStyle] means we are binding to a property of the ngStyle directive. -->
<!-- ngStyle and ngClass take a JSON object as input, but each directive may require something different. -->
<!-- ngStyle: An attribute directive that updates styles for the containing HTML element. -->
<!-- ngClass: Adds and removes CSS classes on an HTML element. -->
