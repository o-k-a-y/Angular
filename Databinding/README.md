Example showing {{ stringInterpolation }}, [property]="binding" and (event)="binding()"

If you want to output or print something, use **string interpolation**.
If you want to change some property (html element, directive, component), typically you will use **property binding**.
If you want an event to bind to a function, use event binding.
