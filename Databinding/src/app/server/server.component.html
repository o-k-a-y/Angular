<!-- String interpolation example using class members -->
<!-- String interpolation only has 1 condition: resolve to a string -->

<!-- Numbers are easily converted to strings, so anything that has a toString() is fine as well -->
<p>{{ 'Server' }} with ID {{ serverId }} is {{ getServerStatus() }}</p>
