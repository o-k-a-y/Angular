      Optimize this app by adding a UsersService which manages the active and inactive users.

      Also add a CounterService which counts the number of active->inactive and inactive->active actions.
    -->

    <!-- 
      My first idea: 
      Obviously we need to make a UsersService that active-users, inactive-users and app components need access to.
      active and inactive-users will update the active and inactive users [] inside UsersService whenever onSetToInactive and onSetToActive are called.
      // activeUsers: Array<string>, inactiveUsers: Array<string>
      

      
      CounterService can be injected into UsersService so whenever the service methods of UsersService are called, we can update the counts there.
      // inactiveCount: number, activeCount: number
    -->
