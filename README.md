# Angular
Angular Projects from https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2

## FirstApp
Literally the most basic Angular application.

## BootstrapAndComponentExample
Example showing adding bootstrap.css to the styles in the configuration schema in angular.json.
Also shows a basic new Component.

## Databinding
Example showing {{ stringInterpolation }}, [property]="binding", (event)="binding()" and [(two-way)]="binding".

If you want to output or print something, use **string interpolation**.
If you want to change some property (html element, directive, component), typically you will use **property binding**.
If you want an event to bind to a function, use event binding.

If you want both, use **two-way binding**. It's just syntactic sugar for combining property binding and event binding.
